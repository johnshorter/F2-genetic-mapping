# F2-genetic-mapping
Genetic mapping using F2 mice and the RQTL package

A short turtorial using genetic and phenotypic data available here (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/690917v1)

F2-geneticmapping.Rmd contains the R code used for this example

RQTLinput.zip is the input files for the first few steps

geno_pheno.csv is the output file from the first steps

RQTL2input.zip	 is the input files used in the RQTL2 mapping section.

The map files contain a smaller number of markers in the input files used for RQTL2 because we were more stringent with markers that had extreme H calls.
